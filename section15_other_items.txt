 15.1  Batteries

All energy weapons and mono-filament swords use energy stored in batteries. When a weapon runs out of energy, after a number of shots or turns, one must spend one turn reloading it. But a character can use a battery pack attached to the belt and connected to the weapon with a cord. This pack has as much energy as two batteries, in addition to the battery in the weapon. The only disadvantage is that it counts as a weapon in size, taking up space on the belt. Only one battery pack can be attached to a weapon at one time and can be removed in one turn. Batteries from every weapon may be recharged between combats for 5₢.
