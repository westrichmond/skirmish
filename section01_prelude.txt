 1  Prelude
Bruce walked through the mist shrouded forest, searching for any rebel that may be unlucky enough to encounter him. Entering a clearing, he spied his quarry. Bruce immediately dropped to the ground. The rebel, now prone, and with his rifle poised to kill, quickly got off three rounds. Braced for impact, Bruce felt the hits slam hard against his vest. The enemy was now taking careful aim. Bruce drew and fired his autopistol and seeing that his enemy was about to fire rolled to one side; the shot went by; another went off. Bruce looked over to see his enemy cursing at his weapon and throwing it at one side. The rebel stood up and pulled off a grenade. Bruce took carful aim and fired off the remaining rounds in his magazine. The rebel reeled with the impact of hit after hit and slumped to the ground. A wounded but alive Bruce Corr of the Colony Defense Team let out a sigh of relief and rose to his feet.
