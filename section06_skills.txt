 6  Skills 
Skills are abilities or knowledge that a character has learned to do. In general a character cannot do something unless he has the skill for it. Some abilities can be done without having learned a skill, but with an additional penalty to success. For example, characters can use weapons that they do not have a skill for, but they are at a -4 DEX modifier when trying to hit. No skill is needed to fight with certain improvised weapons.

A starting character can learn a total number of Skills equal to his Intelligence; some Skills take up two or more "slots" toward this total. The cost of each Skill, as well as the minimum Intelligence required to learn it, is noted following the Skill's description. A character cannot learn a Skill unless his Intelligence is equal to or greater than its INT minimum. Some skills have prerequisites of other skills or other attribute minimums. A character can change their skills between, but not during, combats. 

Many Skills call for an Attribute Check under certain circumstances; normally an Attribute Check is only required in a situation of combat, conflict, or other stress. An Attribute Check should only be required if the consequences of failure are as interesting as those of success. 

Prerequisites: For some Skills a prerequisite is listed. The character must have all of the prerequisites in place for a Skill before he can learn it. For instance, if a Skill calls for having a Dexterity score of 13 or more, plus the Swords Skill, the character must have 13 or more Dexterity and Swords before he can learn the other one.
